# Priorty
Priority is a personal assistant for when you don't know what to do next. 

The inspiration for this app came after seeing an (unfortunately lost) TikTok of a person explaining that people with ADHD could benefit greatly from a digital personal assistant to help them better understand how to stay on top of their responsibilities. I decided to make a version of this!

## The app contains three pages:
1. A quiz on the urgency of and passion for a new task
2. A database of submitted tasked ranked by the combination of these criteria
3. A focus screen that offers up the most important task along with a Pomodoro timer

## You can see a demo here:
