# Priorty
Priority is a personal assistant for when you don't know what to do next. 

The inspiration for this app came from seeing an (unfortunately lost) TikTok of a person explaining that people with ADHD could benefit from a digital personal assistant to help understand how to stay on top of their responsibilities. As someone with ADHD, I concurred and decided to make a version!

## The app contains three pages:
1. A quiz on the urgency of and passion for a new task
2. A database of submitted tasked ranked by the combination of these criteria
3. A focus screen that offers up the most important task along with a Pomodoro timer
